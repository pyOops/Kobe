    "# 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the computing element of this module is to provide you with a set of tools for data analysis and numerical modelling using computational methods. The tools you will use include microsoft excel spreadsheets, python programmes and jupyter notebooks. Since this module is about systems you will write systems of programmes which will interact. This might include python programmes which interact with excel workbooks or multiple python programmes or jupyter notebooks and python programmes. So before you open up your python editor, use the system engineering approaches you have learnt in this module to identify the requirements before decomposing your program into smaller functions. Think also how you can implement the software system and verify and validate each function and the whole program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Part 1 Design and Computing module you learnt the fundamentals of python programming. This generally required you to write python code from scratch to perform basic calculations and operations. This is a very important skill, but one of the benefits of a programming language like python is the very large user base and packages of functions. This module will make use of the inbuilt functions within modules such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also use Microsoft Excel worksheets to perform some basic calculations. Excel is a very powerful piece of software which is used extensively in industry. It is very useful for storing and visualizing data. However, there are some operations which are better performed in a programming language such as python. I tend to use Excel for storing data, performing basic operations such as sorting, filtering and producing formatted tables. I quickly found that in order to produce good quality graphs that it is better to use a scripting language such as python, as this allows you much more control over the final graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, jupyter notebooks are used to provide you with the notes for the computing part of the module. The main reason for this is that it allows you to ineract with the python code examples provided in the notes and means the notes are more of an interactive workbook than static notes. It also allows the code examples to be copied into an Interactive Development Enviroment (IDE) such as Spyder without errors."
