    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Ships travel in water, so we have to understand fluid dynamics. One of the most common things in fluid dynamics is vectors. We call a quantity that has both magnitude and direction a <b style=\"color:red\">VECTOR</b>. For example, force, momentum, etc., are vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2Basic Operations of Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Like scalars, vectors can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided. However, since the vector has a direction, the calculation of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division must be performed not only on the size but also on the direction. In general, in a coordinate system, a vector can be determined by multiple scalars that form a coordinate, and the \"direction\" formed by the coordinate and the origin is called the direction. Therefore, we can express the vector in coordinate form, and then add, subtract, multiply, and divide four operations for each component (since these coordinates are all scalars), and finally get a new vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the geometric sense, the addition or subtraction of a vector means that the head of one vector (arrow position) is connected to the tail of another vector, and the superimposed vector is equal to the tail of the first vector pointing to the head of the second vector, which is the new vector.\n",

    "Multiplication of vectors is mainly a cross product and a dot product. This is due to the direction. According to the mathematical definition:\n",

    "Imagine you're driving a submarine. A submarine is like a car running under water. When you want to change the direction of the submarine, you turn something called a \"rudder,\" just like you turn the steering wheel when you drive a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you turn the rudder, it creates a current behind the submarine that acts like a hand, pushing the submarine in the direction you want it to go. That's why turning the rudder allows the submarine to change direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the horizontal plane, when you turn the rudder, the submarine will rotate as it goes forward. It's like when you're driving a car, you're going forward and you're turning. At the same time, the submarine also creates something called a <b style=\"color:red\">Drift Angle</b>, just like your car tilts when you turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the vertical side, when you want the submarine to go up or down, you turn another thing called the elevator. It's like when you're driving a car, you want to speed up or slow down. Underwater, though, things get a little more complicated. Sometimes, even if you want a submarine to come up, it won't necessarily come up. This is because the relationship between the buoyancy of the water and the gravity of the submarine is complex. Similarly, when you turn the elevator, the submarine doesn't spin the same way you turn the rudder."

This is similar to when you are driving a racing car to drift, except that the drift will look more obvious because the water has less resistance to flow. Therefore, in ship maneuvering, this \"drift\" is a factor we must consider. Imagine the following scenario:\n",

But we can visualize this phenomenon as the drift of a racing car."

    "Ship maneuverability equation is an important tool in navigation, which is used to describe the motion characteristics and maneuverability of ships under various environmental conditions. These equations help us understand how the ship responds to inputs from rudders, propellers, and other control devices, as well as how the ship interacts with the surrounding current.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of ship maneuverability equation lies in the fact that it can accurately simulate the dynamic behavior of ship in the course of sailing. Through these equations, we can predict and optimize the trajectory, speed and attitude of the ship under various sailing conditions to achieve safe, efficient and energy efficient sailing. In addition, these equations also provide an important basis for ship design, construction and retrofit, and help engineers understand the dynamic characteristics of ships and carry out targeted optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, ship maneuverability equation provides us with a key tool to understand and predict ship behavior, which is of great significance for Marine safety, efficiency and energy saving."
