    "The Fourier transform represents the ability to express a function satisfying certain conditions as a trigonometric function (sine and/or cosine) or a linear combination of their integrals.\n",
    "In different fields of study, the Fourier transform has many different variants, such as the continuous Fourier transform and the discrete Fourier transform. Fourier's analysis was originally proposed as a tool for analytical analysis of thermal processes."

    "Orthogonality is the concept of linear algebra, a generalization of the intuitive concept of vertical. As an adjective, it has meaning only in a definite inner product space. Two vectors in the inner product space are said to be orthogonal if their inner product is $0$. Orthogonality can be intuitively understood as vertical if the Angle between vectors can be defined. In physics: the independence of motion can also be explained in terms of orthogonality. In addition, the definition of orthogonal function system is supplemented here: in the trigonometric function system, the integral of any product of two different functions on the interval $[-\\pi,\\pi]$ is equal to $0$, then the system of such trigonometric functions is called the orthogonal function system.\n",

    "Due to the rapid development of computer technology, in the mid-1970s, some electronic equipment companies in the United States and Japan began to design and produce digital Fourier analyzer, but because of the large amount of computation of discrete Fourier transform, until the fast algorithm of DFT (FFT) was discovered, finite discrete Fourier transform (DFT) was really widely used. FFT is an efficient algorithm of DFT called fast Fourier transform. Fourier transform is one of the most basic methods in time-frequency domain transform analysis. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) used in digital processing is the basis for many digital signal processing methods.\n",
